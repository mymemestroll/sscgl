Denominator transformation: 24 → 7 (Take the reciprocal of the numerator and denominator from 24 → 7). 2. 11/15 and 11/30 Now, analyze how 11/15 is related to 11/30: Numerator transformation: 11 → 11 (No change in the numerator). Denominator transformation: 15 → 30 (Multiply the denominator by 2). Step 2: Apply the logic to 9/13 Now apply the same logic to 9/13: Numerator transformation: 9 → 9 (No change in the numerator, similar to the second pair).

Time breakdown Let the total time taken to fill the tank be T minutes. - For the first (T - 2) minutes, all three pipes (A, B, and C) are open. - For the last 2 minutes, pipes A and B are open, but pipe C is closed. 2. Work done in the first (T - 2) minutes Combined rate of A, B, and C: (1/10) + (1/20) - (1/30) Taking LCM of 10, 20, and 30: LCM = 60 Combined rate = (6 + 3 - 2) / 60 = 7/60 of the tank per minute. In (T - 2) minutes, the work done is: Work = Rate × Time = (7/60) × (T - 2) 3. Work done in the last 2 minutes In the last 2 minutes, only pipes A and B are open. Combined rate of A and B: (1/10) + (1/20) Taking LCM of 10 and 20: LCM = 20 Combined rate = (2 + 1) / 20 = 3/20 of the tank per minute. In 2 minutes, the work done is: Work = Rate × Time = (3/20) × 2 = 6/20 = 3/10 of the tank. 4. Total work done The total work done (to fill the tank) is equal to 1 tank. Therefore: Work in (T - 2) minutes + Work in last 2 minutes = 1 (7/60) × (T - 2) + 3/10 = 1 5. Solve for T Step 1: Simplify the equation: (7/60) × (T - 2) + 3/10 = 1 Convert 3/10 to a denominator of 60: 3/10 = 18/60 Therefore: (7/60) × (T - 2) + 18/60 = 60/60 Simplify: (7/60) × (T - 2) = 42/60 Multiply through by 60 to clear the denominator: 7(T - 2) = 42 Solve for T: 7T - 14 = 42 7T = 56 T = 8 6.

We are given the following conditions: Total number of coins = 25 ⟹ x + y + z = 25 Total value of coins = ₹120 ⟹ 10x + 5y + 2z = 120 Step 1: Solve for z From the first equation: z = 25 - x - y. Substitute this into the second equation: 10x + 5y + 2(25 - x - y) = 120. Step 2: Simplify the equation Expand and simplify: 10x + 5y + 50 - 2x - 2y = 120 Combine like terms: 8x + 3y + 50 = 120 Subtract 50 from both sides: 8x + 3y = 70. Step 3: Solve for x and y To find integer solutions, test possible values of x (number of ₹10 coins): If x = 8 (₹10 coins): Substitute into the equation 8x + 3y = 70: 8(8) + 3y = 70 64 + 3y = 70 3y = 6 ⟹ y = 2. From z = 25 - x - y: z = 25 - 8 - 2 = 15. Step 4: Verify the solution - Number of ₹10 coins (x) = 8 - Number of ₹5 coins (y) = 2 - Number of ₹2 coins (z) = 15 Check the total value: 10(8) + 5(2) + 2(15) = 80 + 10 + 30 = 120 Check the total number of coins: 8 + 2 + 15 = 25. Both conditions are satisfied. Final Answer The number of ₹10 coins used is: 8.",

We need to find the average of the 11th and 12th numbers. Step 1: Find the total sum of the 12 numbers The total sum of the 12 numbers is: Average × Total Numbers = 48 × 12 = 576. Step 2: Find the sum of the first 9 numbers - The sum of the first 5 numbers is: 5 × 45 = 225. - The sum of the next 4 numbers is: 4 × 52 = 208. Therefore, the sum of the first 9 numbers is: 225 + 208 = 433. Step 3: Express the 10th, 11th, and 12th numbers Let the 11th number be x. - The 10th number is 10 less than the 11th number: 10th number = x - 10. - The 10th number is also 5 more than the 12th number: 12th number = (x - 10) - 5 = x - 15. Step 4: Sum of all 12 numbers The sum of the first 9 numbers, 10th, 11th, and 12th numbers is equal to 576: 433+(x−10)+x+(x−15) = 576 Simplify: 433+x−10+x+x−15 = 576 Combine like terms: 433+3x−25 = 576 3x+408 = 576 Subtract 408 from both sides: 3x = 168 Solve for x: x = 56. Step 5: Find the 11th and 12th numbers - The 11th number is x = 56. - The 12th number is x−15 = 56−15 = 41. Step 6: Average of the 11th and 12th numbers The average of the 11th and 12th numbers is: 11th number+12th number Average = 2 Substitute the values: 56+41 97 Average = = = 48.5 2 2 Final Answer The average of the 11th and 12th numbers is: 48.5.",

Substitute this into the equation: 2 2 2(1 + cot θ) + 3cot θ = 17 Expand and simplify: 2 2 2 + 2cot θ + 3cot θ = 17 2 2 + 5cot θ = 17 2 5cot θ = 15 2 cot θ = 3 Step 2: Solve for cotθ: Take the square root of both sides: cotθ = √3 Step 3: Find the value of θ: From trigonometric tables, when cotθ = √3: θ = 30° Final Answer: The value of θ is 30°.",

Time breakdown Let the total time taken to fill the tank be T minutes. - For the first (T - 2) minutes, all three pipes (A, B, and C) are open. - For the last 2 minutes, pipes A and B are open, but pipe C is closed. 2. Work done in the first (T - 2) minutes Combined rate of A, B, and C: (1/10) + (1/20) - (1/30) Taking LCM of 10, 20, and 30: LCM = 60 Combined rate = (6 + 3 - 2) / 60 = 7/60 of the tank per minute. In (T - 2) minutes, the work done is: Work = Rate × Time = (7/60) × (T - 2) 3. Work done in the last 2 minutes In the last 2 minutes, only pipes A and B are open. Combined rate of A and B: (1/10) + (1/20) Taking LCM of 10 and 20: LCM = 20 Combined rate = (2 + 1) / 20 = 3/20 of the tank per minute. In 2 minutes, the work done is: Work = Rate × Time = (3/20) × 2 = 6/20 = 3/10 of the tank. 4. Total work done The total work done (to fill the tank) is equal to 1 tank. Therefore: Work in (T - 2) minutes + Work in last 2 minutes = 1 (7/60) × (T - 2) + 3/10 = 1 5. Solve for T Step 1: Simplify the equation: (7/60) × (T - 2) + 3/10 = 1 Convert 3/10 to a denominator of 60: 3/10 = 18/60 Therefore: (7/60) × (T - 2) + 18/60 = 60/60 Simplify: (7/60) × (T - 2) = 42/60 Multiply through by 60 to clear the denominator: 7(T - 2) = 42 Solve for T: 7T - 14 = 42 7T = 56 T = 8 6.

Substitute this into the second equation: 10x + 5y + 2(25 - x - y) = 120. Step 2: Simplify the equation Expand and simplify: 10x + 5y + 50 - 2x - 2y = 120 Combine like terms: 8x + 3y + 50 = 120 Subtract 50 from both sides: 8x + 3y = 70. Step 3: Solve for x and y To find integer solutions, test possible values of x (number of ₹10 coins): If x = 8 (₹10 coins): Substitute into the equation 8x + 3y = 70: 8(8) + 3y = 70 64 + 3y = 70 3y = 6 ⟹ y = 2.

We need to find the average of the 11th and 12th numbers. Step 1: Find the total sum of the 12 numbers The total sum of the 12 numbers is: Average × Total Numbers = 48 × 12 = 576. Step 2: Find the sum of the first 9 numbers - The sum of the first 5 numbers is: 5 × 45 = 225. - The sum of the next 4 numbers is: 4 × 52 = 208. Therefore, the sum of the first 9 numbers is: 225 + 208 = 433. Step 3: Express the 10th, 11th, and 12th numbers Let the 11th number be x. - The 10th number is 10 less than the 11th number: 10th number = x - 10. - The 10th number is also 5 more than the 12th number: 12th number = (x - 10) - 5 = x - 15. Step 4: Sum of all 12 numbers The sum of the first 9 numbers, 10th, 11th, and 12th numbers is equal to 576: 433+(x−10)+x+(x−15) = 576 Simplify: 433+x−10+x+x−15 = 576 Combine like terms: 433+3x−25 = 576 3x+408 = 576 Subtract 408 from both sides: 3x = 168 Solve for x: x = 56. Step 5: Find the 11th and 12th numbers - The 11th number is x = 56. - The 12th number is x−15 = 56−15 = 41. Step 6: Average of the 11th and 12th numbers The average of the 11th and 12th numbers is: 11th number+12th number Average = 2 Substitute the values: 56+41 97 Average = = = 48.5 2 2 Final Answer The average of the 11th and 12th numbers is: 48.5.",

Let the angles be 17x, 13x, and 15x, where x is the common multiple. 17x + 13x + 15x = 180 Simplify: 45x = 180 Solve for x: x = 180 ÷ 45 = 4 Step 2: Calculate the three angles: The largest angle = 17x = 17 × 4 = 68° The smallest angle = 13x = 13 × 4 = 52° The middle angle = 15x = 15 × 4 = 60° Step 3: Find the positive difference between the largest and smallest angles: 68° − 52° = 16° Final Answer: The positive difference between the largest and smallest angles is 16°.",
